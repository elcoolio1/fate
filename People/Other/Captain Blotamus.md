Elven ship captain and explorer.
During the transport of part of [[HIM]]'s rare beast collection through a [[warp conduit]] a warp storm struck the ship, merging the crew and cargo. Captain Blotamus took on the characteristics of a hippopotamus. Upon returning to imperial controlled space, all crew were found guilty of crimes against reality and were sentenced to death. However, the captain was personally pardoned by [[HIM]] because do his role in establishing imperial control in the [[Waxen Prairies]]. Blotamus also managed to negotiate a commuted sentence for his Chief Navigational Officer [[Felix Purdy]] due to the officer's "unique aptitude for realspace navigational calculations" enabling the captain to "serve the empire with vastly improved efficacy regarding exploratory and militaristic endeavours"
