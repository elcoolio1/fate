#TODO make world aspects from issues. Decide if issues should be shorter/smaller scale
Issues:
- impending: 
	- World collapsing into the hole (how to reveal?)
- current:
	- The world is under the iron heel of the [[IFE]]
- Smaller scale
	- Impending Inquisition
		- [[Imperial Inquisitor]] is coming and they must have something to show at audit time
	- Here Be Monsters, Magic, and Mystery
		- The [[Warp]] is a dark, dangerous, densely populated place with many strange places and creatures


Character problems:
- Sinbar has the
	- Backyard biohacking little brother aspect, which implies
		- he has medical problems
	- Tarnished by toxicity aspect, which implies
		- he might run out of serum
	- Granny Cavehand's favourite grandson aspect, which implies
		- he might have to choose between what GC would do and what his orders are
- Skarbar has the
	- Incredibly lazy mechanical savant aspect, which implies
		- he might forget to do something important
	- Short temper aspect, which implies
		- he might blow his cool in front of a superior


Scenario 1:
- Deep dive discovers human village, then inquisitor comes
