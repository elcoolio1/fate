After the [[War of Human Aggression]], the [[IFE]] set up a warpgate near a very large, flat fragment of plains. This land has been developed into 10's of thousands of hectares of highly productive wildflower prairies dotted with bee-houses, called the [[Waxen Prairies]]. The thriving port (big city for you guys growing up) of Waxengate developed near the warpgate to support the export of beeswax for official use in imperial seals across the [[IFE]].
